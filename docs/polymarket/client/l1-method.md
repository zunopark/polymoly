# L1 Methods

> These methods require a wallet signer (private key) but do not require user API credentials. Use these for initial setup.

## Client Initialization

L1 methods require the client to initialize with a signer.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript  theme={null}
    import { ClobClient } from "@polymarket/clob-client";
    import { Wallet } from "ethers";

    const signer = new Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);

    const client = new ClobClient(
      "https://clob.polymarket.com",
      137,
      signer // Signer required for L1 methods
    );

    // Ready to create user API credentials
    const apiKey = await client.createApiKey();
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python  theme={null}
    from py_clob_client.client import ClobClient
    import os

    private_key = os.getenv("PRIVATE_KEY")

    client = ClobClient(
        host="https://clob.polymarket.com",
        chain_id=137,
        key=private_key  # Signer required for L1 methods
    )

    # Ready to create user API credentials
    api_key = client.create_api_key()
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  Never commit private keys to version control. Always use environment variables or a secure key management system.

## API Key Management

***

### createApiKey

Creates a new API key (L2 credentials) for the wallet signer. Each wallet can only have one active API key at a time — creating a new key invalidates the previous one.

```typescript Signature theme={null}
async createApiKey(nonce?: number): Promise<ApiKeyCreds>
```

<ResponseField name="nonce" type="number">
  Optional custom nonce for deterministic key generation. Optional.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="apiKey" type="string">
  The generated API key string.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="secret" type="string">
  The secret associated with the API key.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="passphrase" type="string">
  The passphrase associated with the API key.
</ResponseField>

***

### deriveApiKey

Derives an existing API key using a specific nonce. If you've already created credentials with a particular nonce, this returns the same credentials.

```typescript Signature theme={null}
async deriveApiKey(nonce?: number): Promise<ApiKeyCreds>
```

<ResponseField name="nonce" type="number">
  The nonce used when originally creating the key. Optional.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="apiKey" type="string">
  The derived API key string.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="secret" type="string">
  The secret associated with the API key.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="passphrase" type="string">
  The passphrase associated with the API key.
</ResponseField>

***

### createOrDeriveApiKey

Convenience method that attempts to derive an API key with the default nonce, or creates a new one if it doesn't exist. **Recommended for initial setup.**

```typescript Signature theme={null}
async createOrDeriveApiKey(nonce?: number): Promise<ApiKeyCreds>
```

<ResponseField name="apiKey" type="string">
  The API key string, either derived or newly created.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="secret" type="string">
  The secret associated with the API key.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="passphrase" type="string">
  The passphrase associated with the API key.
</ResponseField>

***

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error - INVALID_SIGNATURE">
    Your wallet's private key is incorrect or improperly formatted.

    **Solution:**

    * Verify your private key is a valid hex string (starts with `0x`)
    * Ensure you're using the correct key for the intended address
    * Check that the key has proper permissions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error - NONCE_ALREADY_USED">
    The nonce you provided has already been used to create an API key.

    **Solution:**

    * Use `deriveApiKey()` with the same nonce to retrieve existing credentials
    * Or use a different nonce with `createApiKey()`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error - Invalid Funder Address">
    Your funder address is incorrect or doesn't match your wallet.

    **Solution:** Check your proxy wallet address at [polymarket.com/settings](https://polymarket.com/settings). If it doesn't exist, the user has never logged in to Polymarket.com — deploy the proxy wallet first before creating L2 credentials.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lost API credentials but have nonce">
    ```typescript  theme={null}
    // Use deriveApiKey with the original nonce
    const recovered = await client.deriveApiKey(originalNonce);
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lost both credentials and nonce">
    There's no way to recover lost credentials without the nonce. Create new ones:

    ```typescript  theme={null}
    // Create fresh credentials with a new nonce
    const newCreds = await client.createApiKey();
    // Save the nonce this time!
    ```
  </Accordion>
