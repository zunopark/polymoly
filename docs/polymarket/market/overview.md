## Data Model

Polymarket structures data using two organizational models. The most fundamental element is always markets—events simply provide additional organization.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Event">
    A top-level object representing a question (e.g., "Who will win the 2024
    Presidential Election?"). Contains one or more markets.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Market">
    A specific tradable binary outcome within an event. Maps to a pair of CLOB
    token IDs, a market address, a question ID, and a condition ID.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Single-Market Events vs Multi-Market Events

| Type                | Example                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single-market event | "Will Bitcoin reach \$100k?" → 1 market (Yes/No)                                               |
| Multi-market event  | "Where will Barron Trump attend College?" → Markets for Georgetown, NYU, UPenn, Harvard, Other |

### Outcomes and Prices

Each market has `outcomes` and `outcomePrices` arrays that map 1:1. Prices represent implied probabilities:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "outcomes": "[\"Yes\", \"No\"]",
  "outcomePrices": "[\"0.20\", \"0.80\"]"
}
// Index 0: "Yes" → 0.20 (20% probability)
// Index 1: "No" → 0.80 (80% probability)
```

<Info>Markets can be traded via the CLOB if `enableOrderBook` is `true`.</Info>
