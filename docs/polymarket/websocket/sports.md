# Sports WebSocket

> Live sports scores and game state

The Sports WebSocket provides real-time sports results updates, including scores, periods, and game status. No authentication required.

## Endpoint

```
wss://sports-api.polymarket.com/ws
```

No subscription message required — connect and start receiving data for all active sports events.

## Heartbeat

The server sends `ping` every 5 seconds. Respond with `pong` within 10 seconds or the connection will close.

```javascript  theme={null}
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  if (event.data === "ping") {
    ws.send("pong");
    return;
  }

  // Handle JSON messages...
};
```

## Message Type

Each message is a JSON object with game state fields.

### sport\_result

Emitted when:

* A match goes live
* The score changes
* The period changes (e.g., halftime, overtime)
* A match ends
* Possession changes (NFL and CFB only)

**NFL (in progress):**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "gameId": 19439,
  "leagueAbbreviation": "nfl",
  "slug": "nfl-lac-buf-2025-01-26",
  "homeTeam": "LAC",
  "awayTeam": "BUF",
  "status": "InProgress",
  "score": "3-16",
  "period": "Q4",
  "elapsed": "5:18",
  "live": true,
  "ended": false,
  "turn": "lac"
}
```

**Esports — CS2 (finished):**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "gameId": 1317359,
  "leagueAbbreviation": "cs2",
  "slug": "cs2-arcred-the-glecs-2025-07-20",
  "homeTeam": "ARCRED",
  "awayTeam": "The glecs",
  "status": "finished",
  "score": "000-000|2-0|Bo3",
  "period": "2/3",
  "live": false,
  "ended": true,
  "finished_timestamp": "2025-07-20T18:30:00.000Z"
}
```

The `finished_timestamp` field is an ISO 8601 timestamp only present when `ended: true`.

The `slug` field follows the format `{league}-{team1}-{team2}-{date}` (e.g., `nfl-buf-kc-2025-01-26`).
